# Yautja-Setting
Currently non-functional settings for the mod Xenotype: Yautja

My best attempt at making settings. Did my best.

Don't know how to tie it to the xml at all.
Any help is greatly appriciated.


Other settings I'd love to impliment:
> A patch that makes the yautja work bench (2,2) instead of (3,2)
> Disable yautja hediffs (claws, crest, leathery skin, mandibles) from appearing in the health tab (change all become visible in stages li[1] to false)
